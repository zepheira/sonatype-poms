# Sonatype POMs

These are POMs we use to publish libraries to [Maven Central][3] via
[Sonatype][1]'s [third-party publication][2] service.  Libraries:

## Lessen

We are considering the former Metaweb's [Lessen][4] revision 8 to be 1.0.

## Whirlycache

While [Whirlycache][5] has moved to GitHub and continues active development,
the older version [1.0.1][6] is what our source currently depends on.
